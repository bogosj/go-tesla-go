# go-tesla-go

A golang binary + docker image to make API calls to a Tesla vehicle.

## Usage

The binary can be run from the docker image [ghcr.io/bogosj/go-tesla-go](https://github.com/users/bogosj/packages/container/package/go-tesla-go).

```
docker run --rm ghcr.io/bogosj/go-tesla-go --spew
```

The binary expects two environment variables to be set:

```
GTG_OAUTHTOKENPATH
GTG_VIN
```

These can be passed in the docker command with either the -e/--env flag or --env-file.

The OAUTH variable must point to a file that consists of a single JSON dictionary generated by https://github.com/bogosj/tesla/tree/main/cmd/login. See the instructions for running this binary at https://github.com/bogosj/tesla#oauth-token.

You can also install a local copy with `go get github.com/bogosj/go-tesla-go`.

## Flags
The flags that start "if" verify conditions before taking actions.
